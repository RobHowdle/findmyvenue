Thanks to expansion, the Old Cold Store is now an industrial and minimalist function facility available for private hire. It is ideally located just a short stroll from Nottingham station.
Essentially a supersized blank canvas, the Old Cold Store has a reputation for live music events thanks to its work with Revolution Sounds (formally of the Maze) and Rat Cat. Complete with a private, full-sized bar, this huge area can be organised to your liking and is suitable for a range of events including wedding receptions and corporate meetings.
The Castle Rock Team Party is held here every year, and the space is put to good use for Castle Rock’s annual Yard Party.
